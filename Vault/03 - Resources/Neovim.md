# Hi windows folks this section is not for u so bye bye

## if you have not heard of nvim before u dont need it so get out and use your shitty vs code

## My favourite start point is to clone kickstart nvim and then build on it

## If you want to follow that u can simply copy and paste this and build it up for yourself


```zsh
git clone https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

## If you want to grab my config just clone it

```zsh
git clone 
```
## I would recomment create a folder called gits in your home directory and cd into it then copy the nvim directory recursively and paste it to ~/.config/

```bash
mkdir ~/gits
cd ~/gits
```
